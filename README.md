# Flowers dataset

Images of five different kinds of flowers partitioned into test, training and validation.

## Contents
This dataset contains `jpeg` images of five different kinds of flowers (daisies, dandelions, roses, sunflowers, and tulips). There is a total of 3670 files, partitioned into training, test, and validation sets:

- Training: 3540 images, imbalanced classes
- Test: 50 images, balanced classes
- Validation: 80 images, balanced classes

The images are of a variety of sizes and aspect ratios.

## Usage examples
This dataset is a of sufficient size for all sorts of computer vision tasks. The pre-defined partitions allow for benchmarking of algorithms. Because the image composition is not standardized in any way (some images are just of a single flowers, some of an entire field, many images include the respective flowers only in the background), this dataset is a good example of a real-world dataset.
